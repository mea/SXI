11/30/07 Drain Driver Board

This board is designed to handle either P channel or N channel CCD's. The
backplane should supply the appropriate voltages on +DR and -DR for the CCD
type:

Type	+DR	-DR
P	0V	-28V
N	+30V	0V

DrainDrive.1.sch

This provides individually adjustable drive for the output and reset drains. The
voltage range is 0-28V, relative to -DR.

DrainDrive.2.sch

This provides DAC circuitry.

DrainDrive.3.sch

This provides external connections for power, DAC control, and clock timing for this board and also the mother board it serves.
