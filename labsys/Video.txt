4/24/08 Laboratory SXI Video Board for Pch Chip

This board supports an MD01 or MND01 quad video chain chip (U1), and also
serves to connect CCD signals to the other boards in the system.

Beware that U1 is broken into several symbols, representing different
parts of the chip.

J1 provides driver signals from the Drain Driver board, and through
it, the driver board. J2 connects to the CCD via flexprint. JF1 and
JF2 connect to the Interface board.

Video.1.sch

This provides input coupling for the four video chains along with
power and regulated reference voltages. Reference voltages are
relative to VL (output from U1). DR (the bias DAC reference) is 1.2V
above VL, while AR (the video reference) is 0.2V above VL.

Video.2.sch

This provides connections with the interface board, mainly digital
I/O. Schmitt trigger U2 receives low speed single-ended digital
inputs. High speed digital inputs are LVDS and go straight to U1.

Video.3.sch

This provides all of the CCD connections except for video signals and
horizontal clocks.

Video.4.sch

This provides horizontal clocks and back bias.

The horizontal clock phases may be adjusted by jumpers. Refer to the
document HPK_2kx4k_Timing_Diagram_20051207_rev1.pdf for diagrams. In
the following, "1-3" means to connect pin 1 to pin 3.

For Timing1 (four output mode):

JS1: 1-3, 2-4
JS2: 1-3, 2-4
JS3: 1-3, 2-4
JS4: 1-3, 2-4


For Timing2 (OUT1, OUT3 mode):

JS1: 1-3, 2-4
JS2: 1-2, 3-4
JS3: 1-3, 2-4
JS4: 1-2, 3-4

For Timing3 (OUT2, OUT4 mode):

JS1: 1-2, 3-4
JS2: 1-3, 2-4
JS3: 1-2, 3-4
JS4: 1-3, 2-4


For internal back bias, connect JS5 2-4. For external back bias,
connect JS5 1-2.
