9/29/07 Driver Board first Release

Maybe I should call this the "Gate Driver Board": I'm currently planning
to put the various drain drivers and "vertical input source" driver on
the "video" board.

There is no digital logic on this board: the "sequencer" and "controller"
boards will provide the necessary digital inputs.

There are almost 400 components with almost 1200 connections on this
board. This is about the same count as the HETE CCD "driver" board. That
board, designed in 1992, was ~300 cm^2. The majority of the components on
it were not surface mount devices, while the only "through hole" device
in this design is the connector, J1. So, it seems to me that 100-150 cm^2
of board area should be adequate for this design. My experience suggests
that the driver board is usually the most crowded one in these systems,
so whatever we decide for board size here should suffice for the other
boards in the system. That's one reason why I designed this board first.

The board provides the following clocks, with high levels adjustable
0-10V and low levels adjustable -10V-0. These should be sufficient to
clock either our P channel or N channel CCD with all sections operating
synchronously.

P1VI
P2VI
P3VI

These are the vertical imaging area clocks.

P1VS
P2VS
P3VS

These are the vertical storage area clocks.

P1H
P2H
P3H
P4H

These are the horizontal clocks.

TG
SG
RG

Transfer gate, summing gate, reset gate.

The board also provides the following DC biases:

OG
IG1
IG2

Output and input gates, range -10V to 10V.

BB

P-channel back bias, range 0-50V.

J1 provides power and inputs to the board, and delivers its outputs to
the AE backplane.

Board details:

drivers.1.sch and drivers.2.sch

These are the parallel clock drivers, composed mainly of subcircuits
(details in other drawings).

Resistors R1-R4 isolate the high impedance housekeeping system from
the voltages it measures.  Similar 100k resistors are present on all
housekeeping test points on the board.

ParallelDriver.sch

This is the high curent/high voltage driver for the parallel clocks. Vps
is a high current input at the clock high level, nominally 0-10V DC. Vpg
is gate drive power for the P channel switch, nominally 5V below Vps. Vns
and Vng are similar for the N-channel negative level, nominally -10V-0.

GoHi drives the output high when asserted to logic high. GoLo drives
the output low when asserted to logic high.

R6 and R7 are "brute force" current limiters: they protect Q1 and Q2
against latchup of U1, sequencer microcode errors, and output short
circuits. They also dissipate the bulk of the capacitive switching
energy, keeping the transistors cool. I suggest Ohmite TDH35P5R00JE,
rated at 35W at 25C case temperature. Whether this is sufficient needs
attention: for example, a latchup or microcode error could turn on both
Q1 and Q2, allowing as much as 1.8A (the LM317 regulator's current limit)
to flow. That's 16W per resistor. Short circuit is worse: the LM337 on
the negative supply has a higher limit (3.7A). But, I don't know what
the power supply will provide, and I don't know what we consider "worst
case". I believe in most cases the regulators will thermally limit before
the resistors overheat, but that depends on clock voltage settings. Clever
layout could help (put the regulator chips where the resistor heat will
put them into thermal shutdown). I think this is good for a lab prototype,
but for flight we may want thermistors and a shutdown circuit.

The 300 ohm resistors are latchup protection for U1: they're 1W SMT
(2512). 12V power limits their dissipation to <0.5W. However, they only
limit current to 40 mA, exceeding the 20-30 mA limits (depending on
manufacturer) of U1. It's not clear that those limits apply to latchup
conditions, though. Increasing the resistance will slow the driver down,
but perhaps that's acceptable. Another thing to consider in the flight
design, after we get some lab experience.

ParallelRegs.sch

In this design, I've chosen to use LM317/337 regulators for their
ruggedness. Their current limiting should be effective protection against
short circuits, and help protect against latchup too. They're not as
efficient as some more modern designs, so if we need to trim some power
we can revisit this choice.

DACtoClock.sch

This circuit translates 0 to 3.3V DAC outputs to 8.75 to -1.25V (for
10V to 0 clock high levels) and 1.25 to -8.75V (for 0 to -10V clock low
levels), compensating for the 1.25V offset of the voltage regulator chips.

drivers.3.sch and drivers.4.sch

These are the low capacitance clock drivers.

TG, SG, and RG drivers are just doubled-up serial clock drivers. We
could save a few parts by making up a single channel driver subcircuit.

SerialDrivers.sch

See above about 300 ohm limiting resistors.

drivers.5.sch

This is the high voltage generator and regulator for the 12-50V back bias.

I had previously chosen 220 pF as optimum for C1-C6, but upon
more reflection, it's silly to optimize this circuit for minimum
capacitance. Increasing the capacitance in the Cockroft Walton circuit
will decrease the ripple without significant cost. We can get 47nF 50V in
an 0603 package. Leave C4 at 220 pF to limit current under short circuit
conditions. The maximum dissipation in the DG403 will then be f*C*V^2,
or 127 mW for 24V swing, 1 MHz.

drivers.6.sch

These are just simple filtered amplifiers to convert 0 to 3.3V DAC
outputs to 10V to -10V low current biases.

drivers.7.sch

A pair of AD5308 octal DAC chips provide the 16 control voltages required
for the drivers. Note that the regulators invert, so a code of 0xff sets
the corresponding driver voltage to its most negative, while a code of
0x00 sets it to the most positive.

drivers.8.sch

These are the housekeeping multiplexors. As on ASCA and Suzaku, the
approach is to feed an analog voltage to a line on the backplane. An
ADC on the "controller" board will handle housekeeping.
